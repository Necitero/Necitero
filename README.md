## 👋 About me

Hi, I’m @Necitero

Github is my playground, as in: Forgetting about it for months and then pushing 10 commits with semi-optimal code in a day since I wanted to try things out or because I got bored. Yes, this happens a lot. Yes, I am scared of finishing my projects.

## Personal plans 🗝️

- Build a React.JS + Strapi CMS powered solution for schools (open-source)
