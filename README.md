## ðŸ‘‹ About me

Hi, Iâ€™m @Necitero

Fully fletched designer turned developer by passion. Github is my playground, as in forgetting about it for months and then pushing 10 commits with semi-optimal code in a day since I wanted to try things out or because I got bored.

_Not needed, but I want to thank my wonderful girlfriend for supporting me in my professional journey ever since before my apprenticeship when we got together, and I fully believe that she deserves the mention here <3_
