- 👋 Hi, I’m @Necitero
- 👀 I’m interested in psychology, websites, robotics, design and technology in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend Webdevelopement and Design, though it's (sadly) not that code focused.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for collaborations right now. 
  I will post things here, depending on what random project I feel like doing - though they will propably all be open-source.
- 📫 How to reach me: necitero@gmail.com
