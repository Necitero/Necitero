## 👋 About me

Hi, I’m @Necitero

Fully fletched designer turned developer by passion. Github is my playground, as in forgetting about it for months and then pushing 10 commits with semi-optimal code in a day since I wanted to try things out or because I got bored. Yes, this happens a lot. Yes, I am scared of finishing my projects. No, I have not been tested for ADHD. Yes, I actually do touch grass.

## Personal plans 🗝️

- Upgrade and modernize my favorite tattoo and piercing studio's website
- Build a React.JS + Strapi CMS powered solution for animal shelters (open-source)
- Build a React.JS + Strapi CMS powered solution for schools (open-source)
- Finish building my Voltorb Flip fan port in React.JS
- Make the world a better place
- Talk more about the stuff I do
